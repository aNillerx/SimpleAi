\# Simple Artificial Intelligence

A simple Python AI bot that can explain words and learn new ones from
the user.

\## How it works - Stores knowledge in weights.json. - User enters a
word. - If the word exists in the database, the bot gives the
definition. - If the word is unknown, the bot asks the user to define it
and remembers it for future use. - All new words are saved and available
in the next session.

\## Requirements - Python 3.x - JSON (built-in module)

\-\--

\## How to run 1. Download the repository. 2. Run simple_ai.py in Python
or the compiled EXE. 3. Talk to the bot and teach it new words.

\## Notes - The AI is offline and lightweight. - It can run without
internet and does not require additional libraries. - Designed for
learning and experimenting with simple AI concepts.
